# Introduction

## About this Workshop
This workshop is for Java Developers looking to start building applications with Micronaut, GraalVM and Oracle Cloud with Autonomous Database. The workshop features several labs that walk you through the
steps to get going with Micronaut and Oracle Cloud.

Estimated Workshop Time: 120 minutes

### About Micronaut
Micronaut is an innovative new server side Java technology that precomputes your framework infrastructure at compilation time. Micronaut can be combined with GraalVM Native Image to build native applications that use less memory and are smaller and faster because of ahead of time compilation technology.

Micronaut also includes a persistence framework called Micronaut Data that precomputes your SQL queries at compilation name making it a great fit for working with Autonomous Database.

- Lab 2: Provision OCI Resources (OCI VM, VCN and Autonomous Database)
- Lab 3: Get setup to develop a Micronaut application locally
- Lab 4: Build an app with Micronaut and Micronaut Data
- Lab 5: Building a Native Image with GraalVM
- Lab 6: Deploy your app on an Oracle Cloud VM
- Lab 7: Terminate and Destroy OCI Resources
